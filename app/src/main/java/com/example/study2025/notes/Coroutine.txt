Coroutines

- Android Coroutines is Kotlinâ€™s solution for handling asynchronous programming in Android in a more structured and concise way.
- Coroutines simplify background tasks like network requests, database operations, and file I/O without blocking the main (UI) thread

Key Concepts of Coroutines in Android

1. Coroutine Scope â€“ Defines the lifecycle of coroutines. Common scopes in Android:
- viewModelScope â†’ Tied to ViewModel, cancels when ViewModel is cleared.
- lifecycleScope â†’ Tied to a LifecycleOwner (like an Activity or Fragment).
- GlobalScope â†’ Lives throughout the app's lifecycle (use cautiously).

2. Coroutine Dispatchers â€“ Determines where the coroutine runs:
- Dispatchers.Main â†’ Runs on the UI thread (for UI updates).
- Dispatchers.IO â†’ Optimized for disk/network I/O operations.
- Dispatchers.Default â†’ Used for CPU-intensive tasks.
- Dispatchers.Unconfined â†’ Starts in the caller thread but may switch.

3. Suspend Functions (suspend) â€“ Functions that can be paused and resumed without blocking the thread.

4. Launch vs Async â€“ Ways to start coroutines:
- launch {} â†’ Fire-and-forget, doesn't return a result.
- async {} â†’ Returns a Deferred<T> (future result), can be awaited using .await().



1. Dispatchers.Main (UI Thread)
- Used for updating UI elements. If you try to run heavy operations here, the app may freeze.
ðŸ”¹ Use cases: UI updates, lightweight tasks like showing Toasts, setting text, etc.

class MyViewModel : ViewModel() {
    fun updateUI() {
        viewModelScope.launch(Dispatchers.Main) {
            textView.text = "Hello, Coroutines!" // Runs on the main thread
        }
    }
}

2. Dispatchers.IO (Background Thread for I/O operations)
- Used for disk and network operations like database queries or API calls.
ðŸ”¹ Use cases: Fetching data from Room database, network calls, file I/O.

viewModelScope.launch(Dispatchers.IO) {
    val data = fetchFromNetwork() // Runs in the background
    withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
        textView.text = data // Switches to the UI thread
    }
}


3. Dispatchers.Default (Background Thread for CPU-intensive tasks)
- Used for tasks that require heavy computation, like sorting large lists, processing images, or encrypting data.
ðŸ”¹ Use cases: Data processing, JSON parsing, complex calculations

viewModelScope.launch(Dispatchers.Default) {
    val sortedList = myList.sorted() // Runs on a background thread
    withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
        textView.text = "Sorting Done!" // Switches to UI thread
    }
}

4. Dispatchers.Unconfined (Runs on the Callerâ€™s Thread (may change the thread))


- Use Main for UI updates.
- Use IO for database and network operations.
- Use Default for CPU-intensive tasks.
- Avoid Unconfined unless absolutely needed.
