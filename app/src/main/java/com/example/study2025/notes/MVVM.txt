MVVM
- MVVM is an architectural pattern that helps in separating UI logic from business logic in an Android app.
- It promotes separation of concern, making the code more scalable, testable and maintainable.
    Model
    - Represents the data and business logic.
    - Retrieves data from APIs, databases (Room), or repositories.
    View
    - Represents the UI and user interactions.
    - Displays data and observes changes from ViewModel.
    ViewModel
    - Acts as a bridge between the Model and View.
    - Manages data and business logic.

[View (UI)]
    ⬆️ Observes LiveData from ViewModel
    ⬇️ Sends user interactions to ViewModel
[ViewModel]
    ⬆️ Requests data from Model
    ⬇️ Updates LiveData, which View observes
[Model (Repository, API, Database)]
    ⬆️ Fetches or processes data
    ⬇️ Returns data to ViewModel


Why using 2 LiveData?
private val _users = MutableLiveData<List<User>>()
val users: LiveData<List<User>> = _users

1. MutableLiveData (Private)
private val _users = MutableLiveData<List<User>>()
    - MutableLiveData allows modifying the data (e.g., updating the list of users).
    - It is private so that only the ViewModel can change the data.
    - This prevents the UI (Activity/Fragment) from modifying LiveData.

2.LiveData (Public)
val users: LiveData<List<User>> = _users
    - Exposes only LiveData (read-only) to the UI.
    - The UI can observe changes but cannot modify the data.
    - Ensures that Activity/Fragment doesn’t accidentally modify state.
