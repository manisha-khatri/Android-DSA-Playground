🔌 What are Adapters in Android?
- In Android, adapters act as a bridge between your data source (like a list of objects) and a UI component (like a ListView or RecyclerView).
- They convert data into views — kind of like translators for your UI.



BaseAdapter() --> it's a base class(abstract) you can extend when building custom adapters for ListView, GridView, or other AdapterView-based components.
