Retrofit

- Retrofit is a HTTP client for Android and java, developed by square
- It simplifies the process of making network requests and parsing the responses, allowing you to interact with REST APIs in a more efficient and readable way
- It then automatically maps the HTTP response to Java objects, removing much of the boilerplate code for making HTTP requests.
- Retrofit can automatically parse JSON responses into Java objects using converters like Gson or Moshi.
- Retrofit supports all standard HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.
- Retrofit supports both synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) requests.
- Retrofit allows customization of headers, query parameters, and request bodies.
- Error Handling: Retrofit provides clear mechanisms for handling network failures, timeouts, and other issues.
- Support for RxJava and Coroutines: Retrofit can be used in conjunction with RxJava and Kotlin Coroutines to handle the asynchronous requests more easily.
