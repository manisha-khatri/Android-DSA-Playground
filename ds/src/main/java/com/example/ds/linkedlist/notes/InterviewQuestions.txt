Linked List

1. Basic Operations
- [ ] Reverse a Linked List (Iterative & Recursive)
- [ ] Detect a Cycle in a Linked List (Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm)
- [ ] Find the Middle of a Linked List (Slow and Fast Pointer)
- [ ] Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists (Merge in sorted order)
- [ ] Remove Duplicates from a Sorted List (Remove adjacent duplicates)
- [ ] Delete a Node in a Linked List (Given Only That Node) (In-place delete)


2. Two-Pointer / Fast-Slow Pointer Techniques
- [ ] Find the Nth Node from the End (Using fast-slow pointer)
- [ ] Find Intersection Point of Two Linked Lists (Using difference in length)
- [ ] Check if Two Linked Lists are Identical

3. Advanced Manipulation
- [ ] Reverse Nodes in k-Group (Hard, but frequently asked)
- [ ] Swap Nodes in Pairs (In-place swapping)
- [ ] Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List (Recursion or iterative approach)
- [ ] Rotate a Linked List (Handling rotations efficiently)

4. Cycles and Complex Structures
- [ ] Remove Loop from a Linked List
- [ ] Find the Starting Node of a Cycle (Floyd’s Algorithm)
- [ ] Clone a Linked List with Random Pointers (Using HashMap or O(1) space trick)

5. Sorting and Merging
- [ ] Sort a Linked List (Merge Sort approach) (Divide & Conquer)
- [ ] Merge K Sorted Linked Lists (Heap or Merge Sort)
- [ ] Partition a Linked List Around a Given Value (Reordering nodes)

6. Palindrome and Rearrangement
- [ ] Check if a Linked List is a Palindrome (Using slow-fast pointer and stack)
- [ ] Reorder a Linked List (L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 …) (Split & Merge)

7. Miscellaneous & Hard Problems
- [ ] Add Two Numbers Represented by Linked Lists (Digit-by-digit sum)
- [ ] Subtract Two Numbers in Linked List Form
- [ ] LRU Cache Implementation Using Linked List + HashMap (Least Recently Used Cache)
- [ ] Convert a Sorted Linked List to a Balanced BST (Divide & Conquer)

How to Prepare?
- [ ] Master the Two-Pointer and Recursion techniques.
- [ ] Practice Linked List pattern problems (merging, cycle detection, reversal).
