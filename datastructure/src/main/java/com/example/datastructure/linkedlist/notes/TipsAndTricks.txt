🚀 Key Tricks to Solve Linked List Problems

--> This will not change the value of head
node k = head.next
head = head.next

🔹 1. Two Pointers Technique
Use slow & fast pointers for cycle detection, middle node, and merging lists.

- Finding the middle node
fun findMiddle(head: ListNode?): ListNode? {
    var slow = head
    var fast = head
    while (fast?.next != null) {
        slow = slow?.next
        fast = fast.next?.next
    }
    return slow // Middle node
}

- Detecting a cycle (Floyd’s Cycle Detection - Tortoise & Hare Algorithm):
fun hasCycle(head: ListNode?): Boolean {
    var slow = head
    var fast = head
    while (fast?.next != null) {
        slow = slow?.next
        fast = fast.next?.next
        if (slow == fast) return true
    }
    return false
}


🔹 2. Reversing a Linked List (Iterative & Recursive)
- Iterative approach: curr, next, prev Pointers
- Recursive approach:
    - Try with 1 node then 2 then 3


🎯 How to Approach Linked List Problems?

1️⃣ Identify the type of problem:
- Reversal? Use prev/curr approach.
- Cycle detection? Use fast/slow pointers.
- Merging? Use recursion or two pointers.

2️⃣ Think about edge cases:
- Empty list, single node, even/odd length lists, duplicate values.

3️⃣ Use a dummy node when needed:
- Helps in handling head deletion & simplification.

4️⃣ Optimize with space-efficient solutions:
- Try using two pointers instead of extra space (stack/hashmap).

💡 Final Tip: Draw the linked list on paper for better visualization and debugging.
