Dynamic Programming


Identifying the dp problem, if the question states:
- Count the total no. of ways
- Multiple ways to do this, tell me which will give me mini. or max. output
- Try all possible ways comes in: count, best ways

shortcut trick:
- Try to represent the problem in terms of index
- Do all the possible stuff on that index according to the problem statement
- Sum of all stuffs = count all ways
- Find min (all stuff)
