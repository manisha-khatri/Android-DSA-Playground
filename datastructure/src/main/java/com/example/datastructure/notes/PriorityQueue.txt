Priority Queue

- A Priority Queue in Java is a special type of queue where elements are ordered based on their priority rather than the order in which they are added.


Key Features of PriorityQueue in Java:

1. Elements are ordered based on priority
- By default, the natural ordering (ascending order for numbers, alphabetical for strings) is used.
- A custom comparator can be provided to define a different priority order.

2. Implements Queue interface
- It follows FIFO (First-In-First-Out) for elements with equal priority.
