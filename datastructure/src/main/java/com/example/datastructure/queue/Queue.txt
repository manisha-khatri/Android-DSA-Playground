Queue

- A Queue is a data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
- Think of it like a line at a movie theater:
    - The first person in line gets their ticket first.
    - The last person has to wait for their turn

How to Use Queue in Java?
- In Java, Queue is an **interface** in the java.util package. It is implemented by classes like:
    - LinkedList (Most commonly used)
    - PriorityQueue (For priority-based ordering)
    - ArrayDeque (Faster than LinkedList)

Basic Queue Operations:
- add()
- remove() / poll()
- peek()
- isEmpty()
