 Interviewer Possible Questions?

    Q1. For parking lot LLD system Design, why we need a licencePlateNumber?

    1. Unique Identification of a Vehicle
    - The **licensePlateNumber** acts as a **unique key** to identify each vehicle.
    - Without it, if two white hatchbacks park at the same time, you’d have no idea which one belongs to which ticket.
    - Think of it as the `primary key` for your `Vehicle` entity.

    2. Integration with Real Systems
    - Cameras capture license plates automatically.
    - The system opens gates or calculates fees automatically.

    3. Fraud Prevention and Enforcement
    - Imagine someone loses their ticket and claims, I came just 5 minutes ago!” 😇
    - Your system can check: > “Actually, your license plate entered 3 hours ago.” ⏰
    -  It also helps detect **blacklisted vehicles**, **stolen cars**, or track **violations**.
